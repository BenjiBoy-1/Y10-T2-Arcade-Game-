Character will have 3 lives, the harder the level the less lives

The more obstacles you dodge the more points you get 
points are displayed in the top right corner, and calculated by multiplying the speed of the object out of 1 (75% speed would be 0.75) by 100.

you will be able to move left and right and can change the sensitivity of the controls. 
You will have the ability to crouch, which coding wise will just be shrinking the hitbox and character in half, 
You will be able to jump and there mightt be platforms that are needed to survive wider obstacles.

for the infinite levels obstacles will be generated randomly out of a select range of shapes
